G12 EVH
=======
The Celestion G12 EVH bears the initials of possibly the most influential rock guitarist of the past 40 years – Eddie Van Halen – an avid user of vintage Celestion Greenbacks from the outset of his career.

So, when it came time to select speakers for his 5150-III signature amp, Ed chose the 20-watt Heritage Series G12M as the most faithful and familiar reproduction of his Greenback tone. And with the inclusion of a custom black rear can with the inimitable red, white and black stripes, the G12EVH was born.

Celestion’s EVH speakers retain the renowned ‘brown sound’ associated with Van Halen’s early albums, characterised by warm lows, a lush midrange and an expressive and refined treble. Drive hard for searing lead lines and an immensely satisfying rhythm and grind.

Countless guitarists have sought to reproduce the distinctive Van Halen sound over the years, and now this quest just got a whole lot easier, with the Celestion G12 EVH impulse response offering you an authentic digital version of this classic speaker.


Heritage G12M
=============
The Celestion Heritage G12M speaker impulse response gives you silky smooth ‘60s tone with sweet, organic overdrive, in a digital format for use in a wide range of DAWs and amp simulators.

The Heritage Series G12M speaker is a faithful recreation of the original ‘60s Celestion G12M, the first of our speakers to feature the distinctive green rear can, earning it the nickname ‘Greenback’. Beloved of many 1960s blues and rock guitarists, including the legendary Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page, the original Celestion G12M continued to inspire players into the ‘70s and beyond.

The Celestion Heritage Series G12M is a modern day replica of this iconic speaker, built by hand using traditional construction methods and materials in order to recreate the seminal G12M tone as closely as possible. The result is a speaker that delivers a rich, vocal midrange, a well-articulated treble, and a warm, controlled low end, with plenty of crunch and compression if you dig in.


Heritage G12H (55)
==================
The Celestion Heritage G12H 55Hz speaker impulse response offers guitarists the unmistakable mojo of late 60s rock guitar tones in a convenient, easy to use digital format.

The G12H (55) features a hefty 50oz ceramic magnet and a lower resonance 55Hz (aka 55 c/s) bass cone. This speaker was originally intended for use by bass guitarists, but was quickly adopted by lead players—most famously Jimi Hendrix—because of the warm ‘syrupy’ tones it delivered.

In singles and pairs it delivers strong and warm lows – but it’s in a 4×12 configuration where it comes into its own, generating a great chugging ‘thump’ of the kind that that guitar heroes are made of. With a densely complex mid-range and a fine-grained treble, the G12H (55) is excellent for cranking out brooding power chords, complemented by smooth and rich bridge pickup tones and flute-like neck pickup tones.

The full set of impulse responses for the Neo Creamback including all 5 individual cabinet configurations. Gives you access to the complete library of IRs for this speaker, at a significant reduction.

The Neo Creamback has been created using a neodymium magnet assembly, making it around half the weight of a traditional ceramic magnet speaker.

Available as a Dynamic Speaker Response (DSR) or Impulse Response (IR), this highly accurate digital representation is voiced to be “in between” the G12M-65 and G12H-75 Creambacks, you still get the low-end punch, warm vocal midrange and sweet refined highs the Creamback is famous for: push it hard and enjoy the ‘race-car growl’ that sets pulses racing! However, the Neo Creamback adds to this the shimmering presence like you’d get from an Alnico guitar speaker as well as some additional note separation thanks to the powerful forces of the neo magnet.
